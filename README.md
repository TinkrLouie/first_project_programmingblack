# Guide for learners: 3D modelling and Blender

## Why learn 3D modelling?

So you've been wondering, why learn 3D modeling at all? Well, everything you see in video games, movies' CGI and animations, vehicles, skyscrapers all have something in common: they were all once 3D models created on software like Blender. For me, as an aspiring computer scientist and software engineer, I want to experience all areas pertaining software engineering. Since the opportunity arose, I decided to try out the 3D design for this summative assignment. There is really no reason to not learn it. 3D modelling is a really versatile skill, useful in many industries, in addition to films and animations as mentioned above, it's also popular amongst engineers, especially mechanical engineering, which utilises 3D modelling for CAD models, 3D printing, from small scale like electronics such as speakers, computers, toasters, etc.; to large scale like cars, jet and rocket engines, and even particle accelerators.

## Prerequisite knowledge

3D design is within the realm of artistry so creativity and imagination is somewhat important, but the most essential skill to have is the attention to details. What you make doesn't have to be flashy or mindblowing, but it reflects the amount of effort and care you put into it. 

There is really no background knowledge needed. Whether you are an artist looking to branch into 3D arts, a young engineer learning about CAD, or even an office worker who's in search for a new hobby, 3D modelling is for you.

## How to start

There's a variety of software that can be used to create 3D models, but for this guide, I'll be using Blender because it's free and open source. Go to Blender official webpage and download the latest version of Blender. Be sure to have minimum 2GB of space on your hard drive.

To start, I would recommend learning about Blender interface, 
First, its visual viewport modes: solid, wireframe, material preview, and render.

-Wireframe mode:

Wireframe modifier allows you to see your mesh as a collection of edges and vertices.
